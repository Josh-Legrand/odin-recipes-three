# odin-recipes-three
Welcome to my Third odin project recipe!

#I will be making this page for a third time and i will try it implement the best practices while i do it. To help the information stick from the course.

# follow me on this journey i am taking on again. But this time a little more clearly!
In this project, I will be demonstrating the history of some key HTML tags and attributes.

The project is simple: make a list of your favorite foods and follow that up with an image and a link to another locally sourced, relative-linked page. This page will go more in-depth on what the meal consists of and how to make it step by step.

Make sure to emphasize key points of what you currently know about HTML.
